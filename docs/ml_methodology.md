# Machine Learning Methodology: Development and Deployment of Tomato Disease Detection Models

## Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive methodology for the development and deployment of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for real-time tomato disease detection on resource-constrained edge devices, specifically the ESP32-CAM microcontroller. The approach focuses on balancing model accuracy with computational efficiency, utilizing transfer learning techniques, and implementing quantization methodologies to enable on-device inference.

## 1. Model Architecture Selection

### 1.1 Evaluation of Candidate Architectures

Several lightweight CNN architectures were evaluated for their suitability in edge deployment scenarios:

| Architecture | Parameters | Size | Inference Time | Accuracy |
|-------------|-----------|------|---------------|----------|
| MobileNetV2 | 2.3M | ~8.7MB | 300ms | 94% |
| MobileNetV2 (α=0.35) | 1.7M | ~6.5MB | 220ms | 92% |
| MobileNetV2 (α=0.25) | 0.47M | ~1.8MB | 180ms | 89% |
| EfficientNet-B0 | 5.3M | ~20MB | 450ms | 95% |
| MnasNet | 4.2M | ~16MB | 320ms | 93% |

MobileNetV2 with α=0.25 was selected due to its optimal balance between size, performance, and accuracy for the ESP32-CAM's constraints. The architecture implements depthwise separable convolutions that significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining feature extraction capabilities essential for plant disease identification.

### 1.2 Network Architecture Configuration

The final model architecture consists of:

```python
base_model = MobileNetV2(
    weights=None,  
    include_top=False,         
    input_shape=(64, 64, 3),  
    alpha=0.25              
)

model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
```

The decision to train from scratch rather than use transfer learning was deliberate, optimizing for smaller model size while maintaining acceptable accuracy given our substantial domain-specific dataset.

## 2. Dataset Acquisition and Preparation

### 2.1 Data Collection

A balanced dataset comprising 300 images per class was collected across four categories:
- Healthy tomato leaves
- Early blight infection
- Late blight infection
- Yellow leaf curl virus

Images were captured under varying lighting conditions, plant orientations, and disease progression stages to ensure robust model generalization.

### 2.2 Preprocessing Methodology

The preprocessing pipeline implemented several critical techniques:

1. **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**: Applied to enhance local contrast while preventing noise amplification (Yu & Fan, 2017).

    ```python
    lab = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2LAB)
    l, a, b = cv2.split(lab)
    clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=3.0, tileGridSize=(8,8))
    cl = clahe.apply(l)
    enhanced = cv2.merge((cl,a,b))
    img = cv2.cvtColor(enhanced, cv2.COLOR_LAB2RGB)
    ```

2. **Image Resizing**: All images standardized to 64×64 pixels, balancing detail preservation with computational efficiency.

3. **Data Augmentation**: Implemented systematic augmentation to expand the training dataset:
   - Random rotations (±15°)
   - Horizontal flipping
   - Small translations (10%)
   - Minimal zoom variations (10%)

This preprocessing pipeline resulted in normalized images suitable for CNN training while preserving disease-specific visual features.

## 3. Model Training Methodology

### 3.1 Training Strategy

The training process employed a two-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Initial Training**
- Batch size: 32
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate: 0.001)
- Loss function: Sparse categorical cross-entropy
- Epochs: 20
- Train/validation split: 80/20

#### 3.1.1 Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss Function

Sparse categorical cross-entropy was selected as the loss function due to its efficiency in multi-class classification problems with mutually exclusive classes. Unlike categorical cross-entropy which requires one-hot encoded labels, sparse categorical cross-entropy directly accepts class indices as integers, offering several advantages:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: By accepting integer class labels (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3) instead of one-hot encoded vectors (e.g., [1,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0], etc.), it significantly reduces memory requirements during training.

2. **Mathematical Formulation**: For a single sample with true class label y and predicted probabilities ŷ:
   
   L(y, ŷ) = -log(ŷ_y)
   
   Where ŷ_y is the predicted probability for the true class y. This encourages the model to assign high probability to the correct class.

3. **Implementation Efficiency**: In our specific context with limited computational resources, sparse categorical cross-entropy minimizes computational overhead while maintaining equivalent numerical stability to regular categorical cross-entropy.

4. **Label Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with our data pipeline which uses directory-based class labels that TensorFlow naturally converts to integer indices.

The loss function played a critical role in model convergence, enabling stable learning of discriminative features for the four tomato disease classes without unnecessary computational overhead.

**Phase 2: Fine-tuning**
- Learning rate reduced to 1e-4
- Additional 10 epochs
- Early stopping with patience=5

### 3.2 Performance Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Validation Accuracy | 89.2% |
| Precision | 88.7% |
| Recall | 87.9% |
| F1 Score | 88.3% |
| Confusion Matrix | See Figure 3 |

## 4. Model Optimization for Edge Deployment

### 4.1 Quantization Process

Post-training quantization was applied to reduce model size and computational requirements:

```python
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8]
converter.inference_input_type = tf.uint8
converter.inference_output_type = tf.uint8
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE]
```

This process reduced the model from ~1.8MB to ~300KB through INT8 quantization, with minimal accuracy loss (1.2%). The quantization process utilized representative dataset calibration to ensure accuracy preservation across the input distribution.

### 4.2 Model Format Conversion

The TFLite model was converted to a C++ array for ESP32-CAM integration:

```bash
xxd -i tomato_model.tflite > tomato_model_tflite.cpp
```

This technique embeds the model directly into program memory, making it accessible for inference without external storage requirements.

## 5. Edge Deployment Framework

### 5.1 ESP32-CAM Integration

The deployment architecture implements a memory-efficient approach:

1. **Tensor Arena Allocation**: 150KB preallocated for inference operations
   ```cpp
   constexpr int kTensorArenaSize = 150000;
   uint8_t tensor_arena[kTensorArenaSize];
   ```

2. **Inference Pipeline**:
   - Image capture at 5-minute intervals (power conservation)
   - Input preprocessing: resize to 64×64, normalize to uint8
   - Model invocation via TensorFlow Lite Micro interpreter
   - Result interpretation and threshold-based classification

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Camera deactivation between captures
   - WiFi connection only during transmission
   - Deep sleep implementation between processing cycles

### 5.2 Performance Analysis on Edge Device

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Inference Time | 120-150ms |
| Memory Usage | 270KB RAM |
| Power Consumption | 180mA during inference |
| Battery Life (3000mAh) | ~72 hours |

## 6. Results and Discussion

The deployed model demonstrates 87.5% accuracy in field testing, with average inference time of 145ms. This represents a successful balance of accuracy versus computational efficiency. The approach enables real-time disease detection with minimal latency, while maintaining sufficient battery life for practical agricultural deployment.

The 5-minute capture interval was determined to be optimal, as tomato diseases develop gradually, making more frequent monitoring unnecessary while allowing early intervention before significant crop damage occurs.

## 7. Conclusion

This methodology demonstrates an effective approach for developing and deploying CNN-based plant disease detection systems on resource-constrained edge devices. Key innovations include the customized preprocessing pipeline, two-phase training strategy, and aggressive model quantization techniques that enable real-time inference within the strict computational limitations of the ESP32-CAM platform.

The resulting system provides a cost-effective solution for automated disease monitoring in agricultural settings, potentially reducing crop losses and pesticide usage through early disease detection.
