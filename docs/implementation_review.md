## Statement Accuracy Assessment

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- **Partially Correct**: 
  - Classes: Your statement mentions "Septoria Leaf Spot" but the implementation uses "tomato_yellow_leaf_curl_virus" (TYLCV) instead
  - Resolution: Statement says 96x96, but code actually uses 64x64 in prepare_dataset.py and 96x96 in tomato_cnn.py
  - The preprocessing with normalization and augmentation is correctly implemented

### 2. Model Training
- **Mostly Incorrect**:
  - Your statement describes transfer learning (freezing base layers initially then fine-tuning)
  - However, the implementation (`tomato_cnn.py`) shows:
    ```python
    weights=None,           # No pre-trained weights
    base_model.trainable = True  # Training from scratch
    ```
  - This means the model is trained from scratch rather than using transfer learning
  - The split ratios (80/20) are correctly implemented

### 3. Model Conversion and Deployment
- **Correct**:
  - TensorFlow Lite conversion is implemented as stated
  - INT8 quantization is applied correctly
  - The model is properly prepared for ESP32-CAM deployment

## Recommended Updates

1. Either update the statement to reflect training from scratch OR modify the code to use:
   ```python
   weights='imagenet',  # Use pre-trained weights
   base_model.trainable = False  # Freeze base layers initially
   ```

2. Standardize the input resolution (either 64x64 or 96x96) across all files

3. Update the statement to mention TYLCV instead of Septoria Leaf Spot
