## Project Implementation: Description vs. Actual Code

### Accurate Components
✓ Uses ESP32-CAM with a lightweight CNN model for edge computing
✓ Processes tomato leaf images for disease detection
✓ Implements a two-phase training approach
✓ Uses Adam optimizer with learning rate reduction in second phase
✓ Optimizes model for edge deployment through quantization

### Key Differences

1. **Disease Classes**:
   - **Description**: "Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight, and Septoria Leaf Spot"
   - **Actual Code**: "healthy_leaf", "early_blight_leaf", "late_blight_leaf", "tomato_yellow_leaf_curl_virus"
   - **Correction**: Your model detects TYLCV (Yellow Leaf Curl Virus), not Septoria Leaf Spot

2. **Training Methodology**:
   - **Description**: Transfer learning approach (frozen base model, then fine-tuning last 20 layers)
   - **Actual Code**: 
     ```python
     weights=None,           # No pre-trained weights
     base_model.trainable = True  # Training from scratch
     ```
   - **Correction**: The current implementation trains from scratch rather than using transfer learning

3. **Input Resolution**:
   - **Description**: Not specified
   - **Actual Code**: Mixed use of 64x64 and 96x96 across different files
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize to 96x96 throughout the codebase

### Recommendation
To align implementation with your description, modify `tomato_cnn.py`:
```python
base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(
    weights='imagenet',        # Change from None to 'imagenet' 
    include_top=False,         
    input_shape=(96, 96, 3),
    alpha=0.35
)
base_model.trainable = False   # Freeze base model initially
```

This would implement the transfer learning approach you described.
