# Implications of Training Without Transfer Learning

## Model Architecture Changes
- Setting `weights=None` instead of `weights='imagenet'`
- Making `base_model.trainable = True` from the beginning
- Using a single-phase training approach rather than the current two-phase strategy

## Primary Consequences

### Performance Impact
1. **Lower Initial Accuracy**: 
   - Without pre-learned features, your model starts from random weights
   - Feature extractors must learn basic patterns (edges, textures) from scratch
   - Typically results in 10-15% lower accuracy with same training epochs

2. **Increased Training Requirements**:
   - Will need significantly more epochs (40-60 vs current 20) 
   - Longer training time (3-5Ã— longer)
   - Higher computational resources required

3. **Dataset Considerations**:
   - With 500 images per class, you have a reasonable dataset for training from scratch
   - But still less optimal than leveraging transfer learning
   - Would likely need augmentation to generate 6-10 variants per image (instead of 3)

### Technical Benefits
1. **Smaller Model File Size**: 
   - Initial model will be smaller without pre-trained weights
   - Can use any custom alpha value (not limited to ImageNet-compatible values)
   - More flexibility in architecture design

2. **Domain Specificity**:
   - Model learns features specifically optimized for tomato diseases
   - May perform better on unusual disease presentations not similar to ImageNet classes

## Recommendation
With your current dataset size (500 images/class), training from scratch is feasible but will require:
- More extensive data augmentation
- Longer training time (40+ epochs)
- Additional regularization to prevent overfitting
