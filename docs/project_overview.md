# Project Overview

The ESP32-CAM-based board is implemented and combined with a lightweight CNN model tuned for edge computing to identify diseases in tomato plants, namely Healthy Leaf, Early Blight, Late Blight, and Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV). The model is built using MobileNetV2 architecture (Î±=0.25) and trained from scratch on a dataset of 300 images per class. Training the model from scratch rather than using transfer learning was a deliberate decision to optimize for smaller model size while maintaining acceptable accuracy with our substantial domain-specific dataset. The training process employs the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001, followed by a refinement phase using a reduced learning rate (1e-4) and early stopping to prevent overfitting. This approach allows the model to develop specialized feature extractors specifically tailored to tomato disease patterns. The network architecture includes a lightweight classification head consisting of GlobalAveragePooling2D, a 16-neuron dense layer with ReLU activation, and dropout for regularization. The final model is optimized through INT8 quantization and converted to TensorFlow Lite format, reducing its size to approximately 300KB for efficient deployment on the ESP32-CAM's resource-constrained environment.
